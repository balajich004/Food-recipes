        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A chicken burger the whole family enjoys! Natasha is my eldest daughter, and her eyes light up when I announce we're having these for dinner. The onion can be finely chopped, but with three kids, we prefer grating it so as to hide it. I usually serve these with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for a very comforting meal!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground chicken: This recipe starts with a pound of extra-lean ground chicken.</li>
            <li>Bread crumbs: Use store-bought bread crumbs</li>
            <li>Onion: Half an onion lends texture and flavor.</li>
            <li>Egg: An egg adds moisture and helps bind the chicken patties together.</li>
            <li>Seasonings: These chicken burgers are seasoned with fresh garlic, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Oil: Cook the chicken burger patties in olive oil on the stove.</li>
        </ul>
